- A special extract of the coastal plant samphire is shown to increase water channels in skin*.

*Results based on in-vitro testing. 

## How it works

- **Black Pearl Extract** (hydrolyzed pearl extract) helps boost skin energy* to help revitalize skin’s activity and strengthen its defenses. It is shown to impact processes* that protect and brighten skin.
- **The Opti-Bright™ Complex** (Angelica acutiloba root extract, vegetable amino acids and niacinamide) features a blend of potent ingredients shown to interrupt the process that leads to dull skin1 while also helping to disperse the accumulation of uneven tone*.
- The LumiVie™ Intensive Serum and Moisturizing Cream contain the Opti-Bright™ Complex and have been shown to significantly improve the brightness of skin** and improve overall luminosity** in clinical testing.
- **Samphire** (Salicornia herbacea extract) - As an ingredient in skin care, samphire is found to increase water channels in skin*.

*Results based on in-vitro testing.
**Results based on an independent clinical study in which 46 Asian women used the product for two, four, eight and twelve weeks.
